### Markdown Preview

- [vim-instant-markdown](https://github.com/instant-markdown/vim-instant-markdown)
- [markdown-viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk?hl=JA)

The first one is used to with `node` and the second one is used with `chrome extension`.
Two solutions are useful but the second one is more better.

## Snippets

- [ultisnps](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)
- [nvim-snippets](https://github.com/garymjr/nvim-snippets)

You can use the `Ultisnips` directory and `Snippets` directory to add your own snippets.
And the Snippets can be used the `json` format which refers to the `VSCODE` snippets.
