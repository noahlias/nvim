## Description

> [!WARNING]
> It's only for me to use, but you can use it if you want.
  It's a simple neovim configuration with a dashboard and some plugins.
  And the project structure is messy, I'm sorry for that.
  Because it inherits from the repositories I referenced.

Maybe I can make it better in the future.

## Data science

There is a plugin `molten.nvim` for data science, you can use it to run python code in neovim.
But I choose the `vscode` to run jupyter notebook, because it's more convenient.
